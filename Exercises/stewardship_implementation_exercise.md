# Exercise 1: AMR Stewardship Program Implementation

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this exercise, participants will be able to:
- Design a comprehensive antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) for a hospital setting
- Select appropriate interventions based on hospital characteristics and resource availability
- Develop implementation strategies with timelines and measurable outcomes
- Assess potential barriers and mitigation strategies

## Exercise Scenario

You are the lead Infectious Disease pharmacist at a 400-bed tertiary care hospital. The hospital administration has requested your help to implement an antimicrobial stewardship program after a recent audit revealed:

- 35% of antibiotic prescriptions are inappropriate
- High rates of C. difficile infections (8.2 per 10,000 patient-days)
- Resistance concerns: MRSA 45%, ESBL-E. coli 28%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 62%
- Annual antibiotic expenditure: $2.8 million
- No formal stewardship program currently exists

## Task

**Design and implement a 12-month antimicrobial stewardship program** that addresses the hospital's specific needs and constraints.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Pre-implementation Assessment (Week 1-2)
1. **Form ASP Team**
   - Identify key stakeholders (pharmacists, physicians, nurses, microbiologists, administrators)
   - Appoint co-champions and define roles/responsibilities
   - Establish communication channels and meeting schedules

2. **Baseline Assessment**
   - Review current antibiotic usage patterns (DDD/1000 patient-days by ward)
   - Analyze resistance patterns by unit and pathogen
   - Assess diagnostic capabilities and microbiology reporting times
   - Evaluate current prescribing practices and culture of antibiotic use

### Step 2: Intervention Selection (Week 3-4)
From the intervention options below, select and prioritize **6 core interventions** for your hospital's first phase:

**Core Interventions:**
- [ ] Prospective audit with feedback (ID physician consultation)
- [ ] Rapid diagnostic testing implementation (PCR, biomarkers)
- [ ] Formulary restriction with pre-authorization
- [ ] Post-prescription review by pharmacists
- [ ] Educational programs for prescribers
- [ ] Electronic decision support tools
- [ ] Enhanced microbiology reporting (organism-ID and susceptibility within 24h)
- [ ] Ward-specific treatment guidelines

**Rationale:** Explain why you selected each intervention and how they address specific hospital needs.

### Step 3: Implementation Planning (Week 5-6)

**Timeline Development:**
Create a 3-month implementation timeline for your selected interventions:

| Week | Activity | Responsible Party | Resources Needed | Success Metrics |
|------|----------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1-2  |          |                   |                  |                 |
| 3-4  |          |                   |                  |                 |
| 5-6  |          |                   |                  |                 |
| 7-8  |          |                   |                  |                 |
| 9-12 |          |                   |                  |                 |

**Budget Allocation:**
- Initial setup costs: $[amount]
- Ongoing annual costs: $[amount]
- Expected ROI at 12 months: [percentage]%
- Breakdown by intervention type

### Step 4: Monitoring and Evaluation (Ongoing)

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
- **Process Measures:** % of orders reviewed, time to intervention, % compliance with guidelines
- **Outcome Measures:** Antibiotic use (DDD/1000 patient-days), resistance rates, HAI rates
- **Balancing Measures:** Length of stay, readmission rates, patient satisfaction

**Monitoring Frequency:**
- Daily: Antibiotic usage dashboards
- Weekly: Compliance with interventions
- Monthly: Team meetings and progress updates
- Quarterly: Comprehensive audit and trend analysis
- Annually: Program effectiveness review

### Step 5: Sustainability Planning (Month 7-12)

**Training and Development:**
- [ ] ASP team education and skill maintenance
- [ ] Prescriber ongoing education programs
- [ ] Nursing staff stewardship training
- [ ] Pharmacy resident rotation development

**Automatic Process Integration:**
- [ ] Electronic medical record alerts
- [ ] Automatic stop orders for high-risk antibiotics
- [ ] Dose optimization protocols
- [ ] Dashboard integration into quality reports

**Barriers and Mitigation Strategies:**

**Potential Barrier:** Resistance from busy clinical staff to ASP interventions
**Mitigation:** _______________________________

**Potential Barrier:** Inadequate microbiology support
**Mitigation:** _______________________________

**Potential Barrier:** Initial cost concerns
**Mitigation:** _______________________________

## Expected Outcomes

**By the end of Phase 1 (Months 7-12):**
- 20-30% reduction in antibiotic utilization
- 15-25% reduction in targeted resistant organisms
- $300,000-$500,000 annual cost savings
- Improved patient outcomes and reduced length of stay

This exercise provides hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and sustaining a comprehensive antimicrobial stewardship program. The experience gained here can be directly applied to real-world hospital settings.
