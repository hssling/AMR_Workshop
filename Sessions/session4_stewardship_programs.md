## Fundamentals of Antimicrobial Stewardship

### Definition and Purpose
Antimicrobial stewardship is **coordinated activities** designed to:

- **Promote appropriate antimicrobial use** (right drug, right dose, right duration)
- **Improve patient outcomes** (reduce mortality, adverse events, complications)
- **Minimize unintended consequences** (resistance, CDI, superinfections)
- **Support cost-effective therapy** (reduce unnecessary antibiotic expenditure)
- **Preserve future treatment options** (combat antimicrobial resistance)

### Historical Context
- **1970s**: First stewardship programs emerged in academic centers
- **1990s-2000s**: Formal ASP recognitions - IDSA guidelines, CMS requirements
- **2010s-present**: Mandatory ASPs in accredited hospitals, international expansion
- **2010s-2020s**: Integration with digital health, AI-driven interventions
