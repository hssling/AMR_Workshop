# Session 7: One Health Approaches to AMR Prevention and Control

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, participants will be able to:
- Understand the One Health concept and its application to AMR
- Identify interfaces between human, animal, and environmental health
- Design integrated surveillance systems across sectors
- Develop multisectoral AMR prevention strategies
- Evaluate interventions using One Health frameworks
- Promote interdisciplinary collaboration for AMR control

## Introduction to One Health and AMR

### The One Health Paradigm
```
One Health Definition:
"One Health recognizes that the health of people is closely connected to the health of animals and our shared environment. One Health is not new, but it has become more important in recent years. This is because many factors have changed interactions between people, animals, plants, and our environment."

- USDA/CDC/FAO Definition (2017)

Core Understanding:
├── Human health influences animal health
├── Animal health influences environmental health
├── Environmental health influences human health
└── AMR emergence occurs at all interfaces
